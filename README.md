# Location Tracker - Flutter App

Location Tracker - Flutter App
This project is a Location Tracking System developed using the Flutter Framework. The app allows users to monitor and visualize the attendance and travel routes of members. The main features include viewing current locations, timelines of visited locations, and detailed route information.

## Features Implemented
1. Attendance with Location Tracking
Accessed from the Menu by clicking on the Attendance section.
Displays a list of members with two action icons:
Current Location: View a member's current location on a map.
Route Traveled: Visualize the route traveled by a member.

2. Member Location Overview
Clicking the location icon for a member:
Opens a Map Screen displaying the current location of the selected member.
Includes a Timeline View at the bottom:
Displays all visited locations for the current day (default view).
Includes a Date Filter to view data for specific past dates.
The timeline can be expanded to see a full list of traveled locations.

3. Route Details
Selecting any two visited locations generates detailed route information:
Start Location and Stop Location.
Total Distance Traveled (in kilometers).
Total Travel Duration.
A Map View:
Displays the complete route drawn on Google Maps.
Red Dots on the route line indicate stops:
Any stop exceeding 10 minutes is recorded as Stop Time.
This provides a visual summary of the member's travel history.
